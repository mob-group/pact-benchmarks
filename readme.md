# Locksteps

This repo contains extracted code samples that can have our compiler tooling run
over them, as well as a collection of runnable benchmarks for the different
examples.

We would like the benchmarks to be as end-to-end as possible where they can be,
and the code samples will be extracted for simplicity of running Philip's
tooling over them.

## Examples

The example code samples we have are:

## Benchmarks

The runnable benchmarks we have are:
