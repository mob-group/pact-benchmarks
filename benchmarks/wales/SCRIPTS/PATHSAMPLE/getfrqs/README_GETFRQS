four scripts to create min.data and ts.data files with frqs from frqs.min and frqs.ts:

1. python sort_frqs.py [frqs file] [number of database entries]

# the frequencies will unsorted and some will be missing if no convergence was reached in CHECKMIN or CHECKTS
# the script will sort the entries creating frqs.sorted and sp.remove
# mv them to frqs.sorted.min or frqs.sorted.ts and min.remove or ts.remove according to your input

2. run PATHSAMPLE with REMOVESP once 1 for min and ts

# in the removal process, some additional ts might be removed due to the missing minima
# the frequncy entries for these need to be removed while maintaining an ordered list

3. get the ts that need to be removed into a file "remove_add.ts"
   one way of doing this is: grep "setup> possible ERROR - transition state" output.remove | awk '{print $7}' > remove_add.ts

4. mv the new sorted file for ts to frqs.sorted.ts

5. run the make_min_data_frqs.sh and make_ts_data_frqs.sh scripts (careful: removes all files *tmp !!!)

6. check the files and enjoy your new lovely data base with frequencies
