add several scripts for submitting and managing parallel jobs

submit_par  : a PBS submit script for submitting a PTMC or BSPT job.  The
output of the job will be written to directory /scratch/$USER/$PBS_JOBID/ on
each node.  If the job ends without error the files will be copied back to the
submit directory.

examine_nodes.sh : a script for managing jobs submitted with submit_par.  Can
easily copy or delete data from a PTMC job even if the job is spread over many
nodes.

mygzip.sh : zip the output files from a PTMC run

query_jobs.sh : print the jobid and working directory for every running job.
