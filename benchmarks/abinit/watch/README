README for file watch configuration
===================================

File names
----------

There can be one configuration file per repository on the Abinit Forge. Each
of these files, named /repository.watch/, where the word "repository" is
replaced by the actual name of the repository, is associated to an Atom 1.0
feed named /repository.xml/ on the Abinit Website.

Location and file format
------------------------

All configuration files are stored in the /watch/ subdirectory at the top of
the Abinit source tree, one per repository. This subdirectory is versioned but
not exported to the source tarball of Abinit, in order not to make sensitive
data avalable to the public.

Each file follows the Python INI file format conventions, i.e. it is divided
into sections, each of them containing three parameters: title, dirs, and
files. The names of the sections itselves should be considered as keywords for
the projects they correspond to.

<pre>
[section1]
title = Summary of project 1
dirs =
  dir11
  dir12
  dir13
files =
  file11
  file12

[section2]
title = Summary of project 2
dirs =
  dir21
  dir22
files =
  file21
  file22
  file23

...
</pre>

The files already present in the /watch/ subdirectory can be used as examples.
Please note that they are monitored and that the corresponding developers will
receive an email notification each time their file is modified by another
developer.
