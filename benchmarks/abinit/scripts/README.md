ABINIT users scripts
====================

A collection of scripts contributed by various users.
The scripts are organized as follow:

- configure
    To ease configuration/compilation of ABINIT.

- post_processing
    To plot, extract or modify output data.

- pre_processing
    To check, visualize or manipulate input data.

- deprecated
    Scripts that are not documented or suspected to be broken.
    Will eventually be removed. If you think a deprecated script
    should not be kept, contact the developers via the forum.

HOW TO CONTRIBUTE
-----------------

Before commiting a new script to this directory, please make sure
it contains full documentation. If your script is a single file,
include comments at the head of the file. If you want to add a
collection of scripts, you can gather them in a sub-directory and
include a README file.

Proper documentation should contain:

- A one-liner description of the program.
  (to be added to the local README file)

- A literal description of the program.

- The data on which the script operates. 

- Usage (how to feed the inputs to your script.)

- The output data produced.

- Author information (name and email address).
