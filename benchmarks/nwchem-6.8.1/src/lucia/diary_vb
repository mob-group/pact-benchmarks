July 4: Testing pilot code using bio trans and Bio Ham in FCI space
---------------------------------------------------------------------
        1) Morning: 1e working with pilot code
        2)evening/nighti(1.45): 2 electrons in 2 orbitals, no sym, working 
        3) evening/night( 2.00): 2 electrons in 3 orbitals, no sym, working
        4) evening/night(2.18): 2 electrons in 4 orbitals, CS sym, working
        (no errors found going from 2 to 4)
July 5 continuing testing pilot code
---------------------------------------
        1) He, 6-311Gss_CS (5 in sym 1, 1 in sym2 ), working 3.50
           Two errors in Expansion  and permutations of symmetry
           blocks found
        2) H2, DZP, 8 sym1, 2 sym 2, working without further problems
           compared to 1
        3) Code with a general number of orbitals and symmetries seem to
           be working
July6-7: Working on book with Poul and Trygve
         Adding code for rotating orbitals in a given GAspace

July 8:  Finished debugging code for working with more general 
         type of start of orbitals
         Debugged the code for inactive orbitals

         Checking with HF, DZP, Various occupied spaces
         and inactive orbitals. Seems like pilot code is working...
July 13: In the previous days code with generating orbitals 
         from fragments have been implemented, routines to
         implement orthogonalization of various spaces have been 
         implemented and testing.
July 14: A configuration based direct CI routine has been written 
         today and is being tested. Routine reuses old config 
         CI routines developed for preconditioning.. This code
         is only doing standard CI
July 15: The above pilot direct CI configuration routine is now 
         working for simple case : He, 3-21, 6-311G, 6-311Gss after 
         correcting a few bugs. Four electron (Be in STO-3G, H2 (2-) in 
         DZP_C2V also okay. Six electrons also tested
July 16: Code for generating the MINMAX spaces of the intermediate
         spaces written. Final understanding at 03.00 the 17..
July 17: A configuration TRACI code written and the first configuration
         route for the non-orthogonal approach written.
         17.05: Code is working for first case: He, 3-21G with orthogonal orbitals
July 18: 08.12: Code is working for first test-case with non-orthogonal
         orbitals (He, 3-21G), He in 3s basis is also working
         08.37 He, 3s 1p in CS working (fixed one bug)
         09.04 H2, DZP in CS working  
         09.11 Be, 4 e in 5S also working 
         09.39 Be, 4 e in 2S 1p also working 
         Code seems to be working in general, running CI on Cr2
July  19-?? : Working on a pilot VB MCSCF code
==============================================
In july19_11:
July 26: First gradient working (orthogonal orbitals), H2, 3-21G, nosym
         Gradient for H2, 3-21G, nosym also working for nonorthogonal orbitals
July 31: First nonorthogonal MCSCF working, H2, 3-21G, nosym
August 1: Second nonorthogonal MCSCF working, LiH, STO-3G, nosym
          Also working with inactive orbitals, secondary..
In aug6_11:
Starting work on more efficient codes and some generalizations


Back working on the code in May 2012...

5 June 2012, 12.05: First MCSCF with active-active + other excitations: H2, 3-21G
5 June 2012, 14.31: MCSCF with LIH working with 1s as GAS 1 working
Jun 10, 12.05, MCSCF with N2, cc-pvdz with Hessian from FD using
               vector function - a few error took some days.
