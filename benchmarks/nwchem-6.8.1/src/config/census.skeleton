      Subroutine Module_Census
* $Id$
C
C     Eventually this routine should print out a list of modules or
C     tasks or something which are incorporated into the present
C     build of the program.
C
C     For now, let's not worry too much
C
      Write (6, *) 'I dont''t know which modules are in this build.'
      Return
      End
